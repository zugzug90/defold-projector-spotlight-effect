Thanks to the Telegram buddy @brace_r for the fragment and vertex shader programs as a starter points.

## How to use
TBD

For now please look into `projector_spotlight_controller.script` as a basic usage case.

## Project Dependencies and Prerequisits
1. Project uses [Druid](https://github.com/Insality/druid) and [Defold Event](https://github.com/Insality/defold-event). But just for demo purposes. The one can use any other custom solution for managing UI controls.

## What's implemented:
1. Hide/Show Fade Screen
1. Configurable amount (up to 20) and radius of the projector spots 
3. Programmatic control of the amount, color and radius of the projector spots

## Out of scope:
1. Tint of the fade. Current is bluish. Can be changed currently in the fragment shader - `projector_spotlight_2d_shader`.
1. Light diffusion behaviors - currently hardcoded as is. No sets of behavior - just one variant currently.
