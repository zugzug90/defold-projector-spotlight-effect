## How to use
1. Take all assets from folders `materials`, `shaders` into your project
2. Create game object, add `sprite` component to it
3. For the added `sprite` component assign a material named `projector_spotlight_material.material`
4. Tweak the size of the texture image (`white_bg_x1280_720.png`) if needed to fit your game needs - currently it is just white image matching the project Display Settings (1280x720)
5. Control the positions, tint color and number of spotlight nodes programmatically in your *.script files in the update(dt) loop or using timer. Look into `projector_spotlight_controller.script` as a basic usage case.
6. You can hide and show the effect by hiding the sprite and additionally control the transparency of whole effect via call:
   
   ```lua
   go.set(projector_spotlight_sprite_id, "transparency", vmath.vector4(1, 0, 0, 0))
   ```

   ```lua
   1 - means 100 % visible
   0 - means 0 % visible.
   ```
   
   So the one can play around wuth any values in between.

## Project Dependencies and Prerequisits
1. Project uses [Druid](https://github.com/Insality/druid) and [Defold Event](https://github.com/Insality/defold-event). But just for demo purposes. The one can use any other custom solution for managing UI controls.

## What's implemented:
1. Hide/Show Fade Screen
1. Configurable amount (up to 20) and radius of the projector spots 
3. Programmatic control of the amount, color and radius of the projector spots

## Out of scope:
1. Tint of the fade. Current is bluish. Can be changed currently in the fragment shader - `projector_spotlight_2d_shader`.
1. Light diffusion behaviors - currently hardcoded as is. No sets of behavior - just one variant currently.
